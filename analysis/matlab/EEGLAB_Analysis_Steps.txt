# EEGLAB Analysis Steps

This document describes the steps followed in EEGLAB to analyze EEG data for the experiment.

## 1. Load Data
- Open EEGLAB by typing `eeglab` in the Matlab command window.
- In EEGLAB, go to `File > Load existing dataset`.
- Select the EEG data file (`.set` or `.fdt`) and load it.

## 2. Preprocessing
### a. Import Channel Locations
- Go to `Edit > Channel locations`.
- Load the channel location file (`electrode_loc_24.ced `).

### b. Resample 
- Go to `Tools > Chage sampling rate`.
- Resample to 512Hz.

### c. Filter Data
- Go to `Tools > Filter the data`.
- Apply a bandpass filter (2 Hz to 50 Hz).

### d. Remove Artifacts
- Use the `Tools > Reject continuous data by eye` to manually remove artifacts.

### e. Re-reference to Common Reference
- Go to `Tools > Re-reference`.
- Select `Average reference` to re-reference the data to the common average reference.
- Ensure all channels are included in the average reference calculation.

## 3. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
- Go to `Tools > Run ICA`.
- Select the ICA algorithm and run the analysis.

## 4. Analysis
### a. Create Study with Four Experimental Conditions
- Go to `Study > Create study`.
- Define the study with the four experimental conditions as a factor.
- Add the datasets corresponding to each condition.

### b. Precompute Channel Measures
- Go to `Tools > Precompute channel measures`.
- Select the power spectral density.
- Ensure all channels and conditions are included in the computation.

### c. Plot Results
- Go to `Plot > Channel measures`.
- Select the measures and parameters for the analysis.
- Generate the plots for the different conditions.

## 5. Save Results
- Save the processed data and results by going to `File > Save current dataset`.
- Save the figures and other outputs as needed.

## Additional Notes
- Include any other relevant details or parameters used in the analysis.
- Document any deviations from standard procedures.
